## 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

### 📦 [Fairfluence](https://github.com/aimanalhazmi/fairfluence)  
Built an open-source Python library for advanced dataset profiling, influence-based quality assessment, and fairness analysis. Integrates with OpenML, Kaggle, and Hugging Face. Uses influence functions to identify important records, helping users debug data and uncover fairness issues. Features include automatic profiling (missing values, outliers, imbalance) and interactive visual reports—all accessible via a user-friendly UI.

### ❤️ [ECG Time Series Classification](https://github.com/aimanalhazmi/ECG-Time-Series-Classification)
Built a deep learning pipeline to classify ECG signals into Normal, AF, Other, and Noisy classes.
Explored 6k+ ECG records, handled class imbalance, and achieved a 77% weighted F1-score on the validation set.
Used CRNN with STFT preprocessing, class-weighted loss, and data augmentation (noise, cropping, shifting, etc.) to improve generalization.
Outperformed classical models and improved minority class detection (AF, Noisy) through augmentation and dropout.

### 📰 [Financial News Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/aimanalhazmi/financial-news-sentiment-nlp)
Built a sentiment classifier for financial news headlines using Naive Bayes, Feedforward Neural Networks and BERT-based RNNs on a domain-labeled dataset (~5K headlines). Tackled class imbalance and improved performance through lemmatization and optimized vectorization. Achieved **F1-score of 0.773 (multiclass)** and **0.892 (binary)** with neural networks. Also explored semantic similarity with PMI and GloVe.
