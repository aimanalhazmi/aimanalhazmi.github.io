## 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

### 📦 [Fairfluence](https://github.com/aimanalhazmi/fairfluence)  
Built an open-source Python library for advanced dataset profiling, influence-based quality assessment and fairness analysis. Integrates with OpenML, Kaggle, and Hugging Face. Uses model training and influence functions to find important records, making it easier to debug data and check for fairness. Features include automatic profiling (missing values, outliers, imbalance), model-based analysis and interactive visual reports - all accessible via a user-friendly UI.

### ❤️ [ECG Time Series Classification](https://github.com/aimanalhazmi/ECG-Time-Series-Classification)
Built a machine learning pipeline to classify ECG time series into four rhythm categories (Normal, AF, Other, Noisy).  
Conducted data exploration, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. Baseline model achieved **71% weighted F1-score** on the validation set. Currently improving performance through time and frequency-based data augmentation and dataset reduction strategies.

### 📰 [Financial News Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/aimanalhazmi/financial-news-sentiment-nlp)
Built a sentiment classifier for financial news headlines using Naive Bayes, Feedforward Neural Networks and BERT-based RNNs on a domain-labeled dataset (~5K headlines). Tackled class imbalance and improved performance through lemmatization and optimized vectorization. Achieved **F1-score of 0.773 (multiclass)** and **0.892 (binary)** with neural networks. Also explored semantic similarity with PMI and GloVe.
